# Overview

## Purpose 
The purpose of the new analysis is to present the key metrics of ride-sharing company PyBer (fares, rides, and drivers) grouped by population density of the 120 cities it serves. The CEO, V. Isualize, will use this information to make decisions to improve service and profitability. 

## Background
The CEO of PyBer, a ridesharing company, has requested information broken down by city type (e.g. Urban, Suburban, and Rural). The ways that customers use the ride sharing service in each type of city are expected to differ, and these differences will affect how PyBer approaches these markets. In the Modules, we discovered that Rural cities have a few drivers, there are fewer trips, and fares are higher than Suburban and Urban cities. Urban cities had the most drivers, most frequent trips, and the lowest fares. Suburban cities were between Rural and Urban in each of these metrics, typically with metrics closer to Urban cities. 

# Results:

The summary statistics show that most rides occur in Urban settings, where there are also more drivers. The revenue, shown here as total fares, is also mostly made in the Urban cities. 

The fare per ride, however, is lowest in the Urban cities, slightly higher in the Suburban cities, and higher in Rural cities. It also follows that the average fare per driver is much higher in Rural cities than in Suburban or Urban cities (where drivers make less than half as much as Rural drivers).
